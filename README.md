# CalcPro

Hey! This is **CalcPro**, a neat calculator I threw together using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s got a clean look and some handy tricks up its sleeve.

## Features
- **Standard Mode**: Add, subtract, multiply, divide—the basics.
- **Scientific Mode**: Flip a switch for sin, cos, sqrt, etc. Pretty cool, right?
- **History Tracking**: See what you’ve calculated, clear it when you want.
- **Light/Dark Themes**: Switch it up depending on your vibe.
- **Keyboard Friendly**: Type away or use Enter to crunch numbers.

## How to Use
1. Snag the files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`.
2. Pop `index.html` into your browser.
3. Click around or tap keys—it’s all good!

## Highlights
- Buttons got a little pop when you press ‘em.
- History fades in nice and smooth.
- Gradient background—looks sharp in any theme.
- Custom math parser (no sketchy `eval()` here).

## Customize It
- Play with `styles.css` for new colors or fonts.
- Add more math goodies to `script.js` if you’re feeling smart.
- Could use some click sounds—go wild!

## Notes
- Parser’s basic, so keep expressions simple for now.
- Works great in Chrome, should be solid elsewhere too.

Made this for kicks—hope you enjoy it! Let me know if it glitches or you’ve got ideas. Later!
